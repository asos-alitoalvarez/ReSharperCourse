# Code Analysis

Navigate to the `ContextClass` in the `CodeAnalysis` solution.

The class contains various ReSharper issues.

* **Hints** shown as a short dotted green line beneath the code
* **Suggestions** shown as a green squiggly line beneath the code
* **Dead** code shown as faded grey text
* **Warnings** shown as a blue squiggly line beneath the code
* **Errors** shown as red text or red squiggly lines

Do the following

1. Navigate to the 2 errors and fix them. What's wrong?
2. Navigate through the suggestions in the file and see what ReSharper is suggesting. Do you agree?
3. Go through the hints of the file (no shortcut). Does it make sense to apply any of them?

Note: The inspection options can be changed either in the ReSharper options or directly through the Quick fix
menu. These can also be shared at solution level through source control, via the `Resharper > Manage Options > Import & Export`
feature which creates a `.DotSettings` file.
